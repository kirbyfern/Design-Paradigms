# Programming Language Pragmatics


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Fundamental topics in the design and implementation of programming languages.
Programing language paradigms. Comparison of languages in type systems, data
types, control flow, subroutines, concurrency, and exception handling.


- Contrast various language approaches to compilation, type systems, memory
management, module organization, and control flow.
- Debate the appropriateness of a languageâ€™s design decisions in a given
context.
- Compare the efficiency and clarity of programs written in a variety of
languages and paradigms.
- Demonstrate the execution of a computer program using a non-imperative
model of computation.
- Construct software to implement a fundamental component of an arbitrary
programming language.
- Solve a problem using a non-imperative programming language.
